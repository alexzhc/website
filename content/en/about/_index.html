Kubernetes being an enterprise infrastructure, you should not use a version that is no longer maintained.
KLTS maintains the versions that Kubernetes community drops officially. Simply upgrading to the KLTS patch
version can enable you avoid bugs caused by newer official versions of Kubernetes, 
no any worry about introducing features that are not currently available, and your infrastructure based on Kubernetes will be more stable.

  <h1 class="text-center">The KLTS process is fully hosted on GitHub, and you can simply Fork the project and build your
    own version of Kubernetes.
    The build artifacts are all stored on GitHub, the images in the GitHub Package, and the RPM and
    Deb packages in the repos branch of the same repository.</h1>
